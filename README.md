# Encrypted ERC20 Dapp

This Dapp showcases an encrypted version of the ERC20 contract, where the amount is encrypted, but senders and recipients are public, similar to Venmo's model.

## Get Started

Clone the project, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dapp should run on http://localhost:5173.
