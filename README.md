# Encrypted ERC20 Dapp

This Dapp showcases an encrypted version of the ERC20 contract, where the amount is encrypted, but senders and recipients are public. This is similar to Venmo's model.

The Solidity contract can be found in [`EncryptedERC20.sol`](https://github.com/Inco-fhevm/Contracts/blob/main/inco_contract/encryptedERC20.sol).

## Get Started

Clone the project, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dapp should run on http://localhost:5173.
